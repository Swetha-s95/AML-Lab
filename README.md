# AI CONVERSATIONAL AGENT USING SEQ2SEQ FRAMEWORK - PROPOSAL
**Abstract:**

Investment in cutting-edge technology is a must for organizations and modern businesses,
A number of contemporary businesses have started spending a lot of money investigating
innovative ways to deliver an exceptional client experience at every stage of the client journey
since customer and employee experiences have become crucial to corporate growth.
Conversational AI offers the most individualized, voice-enabled, omnichannel, self-service, and
multi-experienced customer encounters. Although there are earlier methods, they frequently have
limitations (such as being limited to booking airline tickets) and call for hand-crafted restrictions.
In our project, we are going to build a model that can do simple conversions with a large
conversational training dataset. Using the recently introduced sequence-to-sequence framework,
we describe a straightforward method for completing this task in this paper. Our model engages
in conversation by predicting the subsequent sentence considering the preceding sentence or
sentences. Our model's strength is that it can be trained from beginning to end with fewer handwritten rules needed as a result.

**Statement of Need:**

The current state of conversational AI technology, such as chatbots, is limited and often
needs to simulate natural human conversations effectively. This project aims to develop a
PyTorch chatbot of a neural conversation agent using a seq2seq framework. This will allow for more realistic and engaging conversations between users and the chatbot, providing a more userfriendly experience.

**Issue:** The existing conversational AI technology needs to improve and simulate natural human
conversations effectively. This limits the use and effectiveness of chatbots, as they cannot
engage in lifelike discussions with users and provide a user-friendly experience.

**Need:** Our project seeks to develop a PyTorch chatbot of a neural conversation agent using a
seq2seq framework which will allow for more natural and engaging conversations between users
and the chatbot, providing a more user-friendly experience.

**Benefits:** Our project has the potential to benefit both users and developers. For users, it will
provide a more engaging and natural conversational experience with the chatbot. For developers,
it will allow us to create more user-friendly experiences by producing more natural conversations
between their chatbot and users. Furthermore, this project has the potential to provide a public
good, as it can help to bridge the gap between conversational AI technology and natural human
conversations.

**Project Activity:**
1. Research and Understanding:

 Research the current state of the art in neural conversation agents.
 Understand the Seq2Seq model and its application in Natural Language
Processing.
 Research existing models of chatbots and evaluate the pros and cons of each.
2. Design and Development:

 Design a neural conversation agent using the Seq2Seq model.
 Develop the model using PyTorch.
 Train the model on a dataset of conversations and evaluate its performance.
3. Testing and Evaluation:

 Test the model for accuracy and robustness.
 Evaluate the model’s responses to ensure they are relevant and of high quality.

**Outcome Achieved:**

 Development of a neural conversation agent using the Seq2Seq model and PyTorch.
 Improved accuracy and robustness of the model.
 Improve customer experience.
 Improved efficiency and Increased sales.

**Evaluation:**

 Identify Use Case: Before anything else, you must decide on a proper application,
particularly an instance for the chatbot. What functions do you require the chatbot to
have

 Choosing the right platform: to develop the chatbot, we must select the proper forum, as
many different platforms are available with additional capabilities and features.
 Design: Choosing the conversation's structure and the chatbot's appropriate responses are
part of this.

 Train the bot: Train the chatbot using machine learning or natural language processing
methods. This includes offering data sets and labeling instances of how to reply to the
chatbot's input.

 Test the Bot: Test the chatbot to ensure it provides the desired results. This includes
testing the accuracy of the responses and the overall user experience.

 Launch the Bot: Launch the chatbot on the platform of your choice. This may involve
setting up a chatbot on a website, mobile app, or another medium.

 Monitor Performance: Monitor the chatbot's performance over time to ensure that it
provides the desired results. This includes tracking users
